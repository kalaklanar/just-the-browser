Microsoft Edge features can be configured with group policies. This project uses Windows Registry settings on Windows, and a Profile Manager file on macOS.

You can check which policies are applied in Microsoft Edge by navigating to the `edge://policy/` page.

### Windows installation

1. Open the [registry file for installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/edge/install.reg) and save it (`Ctrl+S`) anywhere on your computer.
2. In the File Explorer, right-click the file and select Open with > Registry Editor.
3. Follow the prompts to install the registry keys to the Windows Registry.
5. Restart Edge.

To remove the custom configuration, follow the same steps with the [registry file for uninstallation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/edge/uninstall.reg). This will remove the modified registry keys from your system.

### macOS installation

The macOS configuration file applies to all versions of Edge. This includes Edge stable, Edge Beta, Edge Dev, and Edge Canary.

1. Open the [configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/edge/edge.mobileconfig) and save it (`Command+S`) anywhere on your computer.
2. In the Finder, open the configuration file you downloaded. You should see a prompt that the profile is ready for review.
3. Open the System Settings application (Apple menu > System Settings) and navigate to General > Device Management. If you are on macOS 12 Monterey or an older version, the application is called System Preferences, and you need to open the Profiles section.
4. Double-click on the 'Microsoft Edge settings' configuration, then click the Install button and follow the prompts.

To remove the custom configuration, open the Device Management settings (or Profiles pane) again, select the 'Microsoft Edge settings' configuration, and then click the remove (-) button.
